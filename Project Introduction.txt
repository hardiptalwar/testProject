Almost all of the things we use today in our lives are connected via the internet. Not just our computers and smartphones , but all the things in our house like clocks,speakers,lights,doorbells,cameras, windows,thermostats,appliances  etc can also be controlled via internet as all of these devices are available to do so.All of this is possible due to the Internet of Things (IOT)  and it's a key component of home automation and smart homes.The way the Internet of things (IOT) work is that it connects all of the things to the internet.

There are lots of  brands offering home automation and smart home devices . Smart devices of a brand are connected to a cloud network. For instance, Philips hue lights can be controlled via  a controller app the company offers. There are companies who provide such devices like Nests,google,amazon,philips,samsung etc . A user can own devices of multiple brands and those  devices couldn't connect  or communicate with each other. The user will have to install multiple applications, which can not only be frustrating  but an overall bad experience. So, the Project is about building a single mobile application that can control all of the smart devices .
